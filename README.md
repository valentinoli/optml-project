In this project we test the hypothesis that the results seen in the paper replicate and that they extend to other log-concave densities.

## Setting up
1. Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit` and then run `pre-commit install`. This activates a git-hook in the repo to avoid issues with git tracking output in jupyter notebooks.
1. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Open the notebook `experiment.ipynb`.
3. ...
4. Great success!
